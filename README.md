# Convolutional Autoencoders vs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as feature extraction methods for face recognition
This work is conducted in context of the course 'Python for Engineering Data Analysis - from Machine Learning to Visualization' at TUM.

In this work, I make use of a convolutional Autoencoder and PCA as feature extraction methods for the classification of images of the [Extended Yale B dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/extended-yale-b-1). The extracted features are then fed to a softmax classifier for classification. The performances of both feature extraction methods are then compared on the same test set.
## Repository Structure
This repository is structured as follows:
* The directory `tutorials` contains a self-explanatory Jupyter notebook that illustrates the methods used in this work.

* The directory `data` contains the dataset and `report` contains the submitted report.
